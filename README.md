## Description

Mokuji is a framework that comes with several components that form a CMS. The framework is
built to make it as easy as we can to extend the CMS. The 'base' components are:

* __cms__     : "Page" creation and management. Essentially providing the content of the website.
* __account__ : Login forms and user management. Allows the CMS component to create profile pages.
* __menu__    : Menu control. Allows the CMS component to implement menus in a page.
* __text__    : Creating, storing and editing text. Allows the CMS component to create text pages.
* __update__  : Installing and updating other components or the framework itself.
* __security__: Provides security tools and settings for good site-wide security.
* __timeline__: Creating and managing timelines, such as a blog or news page.

For more specific components, you can take a look at our
[repository list](https://github.com/Tuxion). All repositories prefixed with `mokuji-` are
components for this framework.

If you need functionality that does not exist yet, you could create the component yourself
using the [development documentation](http://development.mokuji.org/), or you could contact
[Tuxion](http://web.tuxion.nl/).
