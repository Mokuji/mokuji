# Tuxion CMS - Active development version (Alpha)

## Description

Tuxion CMS is a framework that comes with several components that form a CMS. The
framework is built to make it as easy as we can to extend the CMS. The default components
are:

* __cms__     : "Page" creation and management. Essentially providing the content of the website.
* __account__ : Login forms and user management. Allows the CMS component to create profile pages.
* __menu__    : Menu control. Allows the CMS component to implement menus in a page.
* __text__    : Creating, storing and editing text. Allows the CMS component to create text pages.
* __update__  : Installing and updating other components or the framework itself.

For more specific components, you can take a look at our
[repository list](https://github.com/Tuxion). All repositories prefixed with `tx.cms-` are
components for this framework.

If you need functionality that does not exist yet, you could create the component yourself
(an API documentation is planned to come soon), or you could contact
[Tuxion](http://web.tuxion.nl/).
